# Breast-cancer-prediction
Prediction Of Breast Cancer Through ML
Predicting the breast cancer using Machine learning

Breast Cancer predicting with pandas_profiling,Logistic Regression model, Decision Tree Classifier model, Random Forest Classifier model, Naive Bayas classifier model, SVM model

I will compare different machine learning model to see what would provide the best classification results in differentiating malignant tumors from benign tumors.

Using data set from : https://www.kaggle.com/lbronchal/breast-cancer-dataset-analysis

Using tool : Jupyter Notebook
